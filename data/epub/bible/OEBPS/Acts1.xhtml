<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.2" data-parsed="Acts_1_2_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.2" id="Acts.1.2"/><sup>2</sup>until the day in which he was received up, after that he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit unto the apostles whom he had chosen: 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.3" data-parsed="Acts_1_3_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.3" id="Acts.1.3"/><sup>3</sup>To whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days,
and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God: 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.4" data-parsed="Acts_1_4_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.4" id="Acts.1.4"/><sup>4</sup>and, being assembled together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem,
but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, <i>said he</i>, ye heard from me: 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.5" data-parsed="Acts_1_5_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.5" id="Acts.1.5"/><sup>5</sup>For John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.6" data-parsed="Acts_1_6_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.6" id="Acts.1.6"/><sup>6</sup>They therefore, when they were come together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.7" data-parsed="Acts_1_7_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.7" id="Acts.1.7"/><sup>7</sup>And he said unto them, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within His own authority.

<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.8" data-parsed="Acts_1_8_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.8" id="Acts.1.8"/><sup>8</sup>But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria,
and unto the uttermost part of the earth. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.9" data-parsed="Acts_1_9_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.9" id="Acts.1.9"/><sup>9</sup>And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.10" data-parsed="Acts_1_10_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.10" id="Acts.1.10"/><sup>10</sup>And while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.11" data-parsed="Acts_1_11_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.11" id="Acts.1.11"/><sup>11</sup>who also said,
Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking into heaven? this Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven.

<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.18" data-parsed="Acts_1_18_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.18" id="Acts.1.18"/><sup>18</sup>(Now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.19" data-parsed="Acts_1_19_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.19" id="Acts.1.19"/><sup>19</sup>And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama,
that is, The field of blood.) 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.20" data-parsed="Acts_1_20_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.20" id="Acts.1.20"/><sup>20</sup>For it is written in the book of Psalms,</p>

Let his habitation be made desolate,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Acts.1-p3">
And let no man dwell therein:</p>

His office let another take.</p>

<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.23" data-parsed="Acts_1_23_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.23" id="Acts.1.23"/><sup>23</sup>And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.24" data-parsed="Acts_1_24_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.24" id="Acts.1.24"/><sup>24</sup>And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen, 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.25" data-parsed="Acts_1_25_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.25" id="Acts.1.25"/><sup>25</sup>to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Acts.1.26" data-parsed="Acts_1_26_0_0" data-passage="Acts 1.26" id="Acts.1.26"/><sup>26</sup>And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias;
and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</p>
