<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.1" data-parsed="Heb_3_1_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.1" id="Heb.3.1"/><sup>1</sup>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, <i>even</i> Jesus; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.2" data-parsed="Heb_3_2_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.2" id="Heb.3.2"/><sup>2</sup>who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.

<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.3" data-parsed="Heb_3_3_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.3" id="Heb.3.3"/><sup>3</sup>For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.4" data-parsed="Heb_3_4_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.4" id="Heb.3.4"/><sup>4</sup>For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.5" data-parsed="Heb_3_5_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.5" id="Heb.3.5"/><sup>5</sup>And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.6" data-parsed="Heb_3_6_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.6" id="Heb.3.6"/><sup>6</sup>but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.7" data-parsed="Heb_3_7_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.7" id="Heb.3.7"/><sup>7</sup>Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Heb.3-p2">
To-day if ye shall hear his voice,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Heb.3-p3">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.8" data-parsed="Heb_3_8_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.8" id="Heb.3.8"/><sup>8</sup>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Heb.3-p4">
Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Heb.3-p5">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.9" data-parsed="Heb_3_9_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.9" id="Heb.3.9"/><sup>9</sup>Where your fathers tried <i>me</i> by proving <i>me,</i></p>
<p class="poetry" id="Heb.3-p6">
And saw my works forty years.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Heb.3-p7">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.10" data-parsed="Heb_3_10_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.10" id="Heb.3.10"/><sup>10</sup>Wherefore I was displeased with this generation,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Heb.3-p8">
And said, They do always err in their heart:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Heb.3-p9">
But they did not know my ways;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Heb.3-p10">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.11" data-parsed="Heb_3_11_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.11" id="Heb.3.11"/><sup>11</sup>As I sware in my wrath,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Heb.3-p11">
They shall not enter into my rest.</p>
<p id="Heb.3-p12">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.12" data-parsed="Heb_3_12_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.12" id="Heb.3.12"/><sup>12</sup>Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God: 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.13" data-parsed="Heb_3_13_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.13" id="Heb.3.13"/><sup>13</sup>but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin: 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.14" data-parsed="Heb_3_14_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.14" id="Heb.3.14"/><sup>14</sup>for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:

<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.15" data-parsed="Heb_3_15_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.15" id="Heb.3.15"/><sup>15</sup>while it is said,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Heb.3-p13">
To-day if ye shall hear his voice,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Heb.3-p14">
Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</p>
<p id="Heb.3-p15">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.16" data-parsed="Heb_3_16_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.16" id="Heb.3.16"/><sup>16</sup>For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses? 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.17" data-parsed="Heb_3_17_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.17" id="Heb.3.17"/><sup>17</sup>And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.18" data-parsed="Heb_3_18_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.18" id="Heb.3.18"/><sup>18</sup>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient? 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Heb.3.19" data-parsed="Heb_3_19_0_0" data-passage="Heb 3.19" id="Heb.3.19"/><sup>19</sup>And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</p>
