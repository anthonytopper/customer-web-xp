<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.2" data-parsed="Josh_10_2_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.2" id="Josh.10.2"/><sup>2</sup>that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.

<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.3" data-parsed="Josh_10_3_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.3" id="Josh.10.3"/><sup>3</sup>Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron,
and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.4" data-parsed="Josh_10_4_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.4" id="Josh.10.4"/><sup>4</sup>Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.5" data-parsed="Josh_10_5_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.5" id="Josh.10.5"/><sup>5</sup>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts,
and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.</p>

<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.6" data-parsed="Josh_10_6_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.6" id="Josh.10.6"/><sup>6</sup>And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying,
Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.7" data-parsed="Josh_10_7_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.7" id="Josh.10.7"/><sup>7</sup>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.8" data-parsed="Josh_10_8_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.8" id="Josh.10.8"/><sup>8</sup>And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands;
there shall not a man of them stand before thee. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.9" data-parsed="Josh_10_9_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.9" id="Josh.10.9"/><sup>9</sup>Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; <i>for</i> he went up from Gilgal all the night.

<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.10" data-parsed="Josh_10_10_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.10" id="Josh.10.10"/><sup>10</sup>And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.11" data-parsed="Josh_10_11_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.11" id="Josh.10.11"/><sup>11</sup>And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</p>

<p class="poetry" id="Josh.10-p7">
Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies.</p>
<p id="Josh.10-p8">
Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.19" data-parsed="Josh_10_19_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.19" id="Josh.10.19"/><sup>19</sup>but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for Jehovah your God hath delivered them into your hand.

<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.20" data-parsed="Josh_10_20_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.20" id="Josh.10.20"/><sup>20</sup>And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,

<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.21" data-parsed="Josh_10_21_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.21" id="Josh.10.21"/><sup>21</sup>that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</p>

<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.22" data-parsed="Josh_10_22_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.22" id="Josh.10.22"/><sup>22</sup>Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Josh.10.23" data-parsed="Josh_10_23_0_0" data-passage="Josh 10.23" id="Josh.10.23"/><sup>23</sup>And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.

that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
