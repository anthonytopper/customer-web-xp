and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, <i>I say</i>, thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Dan.5.12" data-parsed="Dan_5_12_0_0" data-passage="Dan 5.12" id="Dan.5.12"/><sup>12</sup>forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams,

<span data-osisref="Bible:Dan.5.20" data-parsed="Dan_5_20_0_0" data-passage="Dan 5.20" id="Dan.5.20"/><sup>20</sup>But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Dan.5.21" data-parsed="Dan_5_21_0_0" data-passage="Dan 5.21" id="Dan.5.21"/><sup>21</sup>and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts',
and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen,
and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the Most High God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that he setteth up over it whomsoever he will.

and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron,
wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.

<span data-osisref="Bible:Dan.5.24" data-parsed="Dan_5_24_0_0" data-passage="Dan 5.24" id="Dan.5.24"/><sup>24</sup>Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Dan.5.25" data-parsed="Dan_5_25_0_0" data-passage="Dan 5.25" id="Dan.5.25"/><sup>25</sup>And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE,
