<span data-osisref="Bible:Ezek.33.2" data-parsed="Ezek_33_2_0_0" data-passage="Ezek 33.2" id="Ezek.33.2"/><sup>2</sup>Son of man,
speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ezek.33.3" data-parsed="Ezek_33_3_0_0" data-passage="Ezek 33.3" id="Ezek.33.3"/><sup>3</sup>if, when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ezek.33.4" data-parsed="Ezek_33_4_0_0" data-passage="Ezek 33.4" id="Ezek.33.4"/><sup>4</sup>then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ezek.33.5" data-parsed="Ezek_33_5_0_0" data-passage="Ezek 33.5" id="Ezek.33.5"/><sup>5</sup>He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him; whereas if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his soul. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ezek.33.6" data-parsed="Ezek_33_6_0_0" data-passage="Ezek 33.6" id="Ezek.33.6"/><sup>6</sup>But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned,
and the sword come, and take any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ezek.33.7" data-parsed="Ezek_33_7_0_0" data-passage="Ezek 33.7" id="Ezek.33.7"/><sup>7</sup>So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel;

he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness;
neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth.

if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;

walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live,
he shall not die.

surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured; and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.
