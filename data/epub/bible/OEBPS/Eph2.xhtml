<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.2" data-parsed="Eph_2_2_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.2" id="Eph.2.2"/><sup>2</sup>wherein ye once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.3" data-parsed="Eph_2_3_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.3" id="Eph.2.3"/><sup>3</sup>among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:-- 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.4" data-parsed="Eph_2_4_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.4" id="Eph.2.4"/><sup>4</sup>but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.5" data-parsed="Eph_2_5_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.5" id="Eph.2.5"/><sup>5</sup>even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ
(by grace have ye been saved), 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.6" data-parsed="Eph_2_6_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.6" id="Eph.2.6"/><sup>6</sup>and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly <i>places</i>, in Christ Jesus: 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.7" data-parsed="Eph_2_7_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.7" id="Eph.2.7"/><sup>7</sup>that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus: 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.8" data-parsed="Eph_2_8_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.8" id="Eph.2.8"/><sup>8</sup>for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, <i>it is</i> the gift of God; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.9" data-parsed="Eph_2_9_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.9" id="Eph.2.9"/><sup>9</sup>not of works, that no man should glory. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.10" data-parsed="Eph_2_10_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.10" id="Eph.2.10"/><sup>10</sup>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in them. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.11" data-parsed="Eph_2_11_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.11" id="Eph.2.11"/><sup>11</sup>Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh,
made by hands;

<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.14" data-parsed="Eph_2_14_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.14" id="Eph.2.14"/><sup>14</sup>For he is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition, 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.15" data-parsed="Eph_2_15_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.15" id="Eph.2.15"/><sup>15</sup>having abolished in the flesh the enmity, <i>even</i>
the law of commandments <i>contained</i> in ordinances; that he might create in himself of the two one new man, <i>so</i> making peace; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.16" data-parsed="Eph_2_16_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.16" id="Eph.2.16"/><sup>16</sup>and might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:

<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.20" data-parsed="Eph_2_20_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.20" id="Eph.2.20"/><sup>20</sup>being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.21" data-parsed="Eph_2_21_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.21" id="Eph.2.21"/><sup>21</sup>in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Eph.2.22" data-parsed="Eph_2_22_0_0" data-passage="Eph 2.22" id="Eph.2.22"/><sup>22</sup>in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.</p>
