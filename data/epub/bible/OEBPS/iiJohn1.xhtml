<span data-osisref="Bible:2John.1.2" data-parsed="2John_1_2_0_0" data-passage="iiJohn 1.2" id="iiJohn.1.2"/><sup>2</sup>for the truth's sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever:

<span data-osisref="Bible:2John.1.3" data-parsed="2John_1_3_0_0" data-passage="iiJohn 1.3" id="iiJohn.1.3"/><sup>3</sup>Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
