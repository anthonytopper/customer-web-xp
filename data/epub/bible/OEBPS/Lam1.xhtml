<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.1" data-parsed="Lam_1_1_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.1" id="Lam.1.1"/><sup>1</sup>How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people!</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p2">
She is become as a widow, that was great among the nations!</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p3">
She that was a princess among the provinces is become tributary!</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p4">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.2" data-parsed="Lam_1_2_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.2" id="Lam.1.2"/><sup>2</sup>She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p5">
Among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p6">
All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her enemies.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p7">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.3" data-parsed="Lam_1_3_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.3" id="Lam.1.3"/><sup>3</sup>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p8">
She dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p9">
All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p10">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.4" data-parsed="Lam_1_4_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.4" id="Lam.1.4"/><sup>4</sup>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p11">
All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p12">
Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p13">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.5" data-parsed="Lam_1_5_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.5" id="Lam.1.5"/><sup>5</sup>Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p14">
For Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p15">
Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p16">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.6" data-parsed="Lam_1_6_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.6" id="Lam.1.6"/><sup>6</sup>And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p17">
Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p18">
And they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p19">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.7" data-parsed="Lam_1_7_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.7" id="Lam.1.7"/><sup>7</sup>Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p20">
When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help her,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p21">
The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p22">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.8" data-parsed="Lam_1_8_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.8" id="Lam.1.8"/><sup>8</sup>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an unclean thing;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p23">
All that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p24">
Yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p25">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.9" data-parsed="Lam_1_9_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.9" id="Lam.1.9"/><sup>9</sup>Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered not her latter end;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p26">
Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p27">
Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified himself.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p28">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.10" data-parsed="Lam_1_10_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.10" id="Lam.1.10"/><sup>10</sup>The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p29">
For she hath seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p30">
Concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thine assembly.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p31">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.11" data-parsed="Lam_1_11_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.11" id="Lam.1.11"/><sup>11</sup>All her people sigh, they seek bread;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p32">
They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p33">
See, O Jehovah, and behold; for I am become abject.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p34">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.12" data-parsed="Lam_1_12_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.12" id="Lam.1.12"/><sup>12</sup>Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p35">
Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is brought upon me,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p36">
Wherewith Jehovah hath afflicted <i>me</i> in the day of his fierce anger.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p37">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.13" data-parsed="Lam_1_13_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.13" id="Lam.1.13"/><sup>13</sup>From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p38">
He hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p39">
He hath made me desolate and faint all the day.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p40">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.14" data-parsed="Lam_1_14_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.14" id="Lam.1.14"/><sup>14</sup>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p41">
They are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p42">
The Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p43">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.15" data-parsed="Lam_1_15_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.15" id="Lam.1.15"/><sup>15</sup>The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p44">
He hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p45">
The Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p46">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.16" data-parsed="Lam_1_16_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.16" id="Lam.1.16"/><sup>16</sup>For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p47">
Because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p48">
My children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p49">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.17" data-parsed="Lam_1_17_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.17" id="Lam.1.17"/><sup>17</sup>Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p50">
Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, that they that are round about him should be his adversaries:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p51">
Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p52">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.18" data-parsed="Lam_1_18_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.18" id="Lam.1.18"/><sup>18</sup>Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p53">
Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p54">
My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</p>

<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p56">
My priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city,</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p57">
While they sought them food to refresh their souls.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p58">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Lam.1.20" data-parsed="Lam_1_20_0_0" data-passage="Lam 1.20" id="Lam.1.20"/><sup>20</sup>Behold, O Jehovah; for I am in distress; my heart is troubled;</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p59">
My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p60">
Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.</p>

<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p62">
All mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it:</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p63">
Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me.</p>
<p class="poetry" id="Lam.1-p64">
