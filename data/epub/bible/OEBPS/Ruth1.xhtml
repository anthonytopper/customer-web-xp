<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.2" data-parsed="Ruth_1_2_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.2" id="Ruth.1.2"/><sup>2</sup>And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah.

<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.3" data-parsed="Ruth_1_3_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.3" id="Ruth.1.3"/><sup>3</sup>And Elimelech,
Naomi's husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.4" data-parsed="Ruth_1_4_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.4" id="Ruth.1.4"/><sup>4</sup>And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.5" data-parsed="Ruth_1_5_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.5" id="Ruth.1.5"/><sup>5</sup>And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.</p>
<p id="Ruth.1-p2">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.6" data-parsed="Ruth_1_6_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.6" id="Ruth.1.6"/><sup>6</sup>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people in giving them bread. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.7" data-parsed="Ruth_1_7_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.7" id="Ruth.1.7"/><sup>7</sup>And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.8" data-parsed="Ruth_1_8_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.8" id="Ruth.1.8"/><sup>8</sup>And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother's house: Jehovah deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.

<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.11" data-parsed="Ruth_1_11_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.11" id="Ruth.1.11"/><sup>11</sup>And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.12" data-parsed="Ruth_1_12_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.12" id="Ruth.1.12"/><sup>12</sup>Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say,
I have hope, if I should even have a husband to-night, and should also bear sons; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.13" data-parsed="Ruth_1_13_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.13" id="Ruth.1.13"/><sup>13</sup>would ye therefore tarry till they were grown? would ye therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of Jehovah is gone forth against me. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.14" data-parsed="Ruth_1_14_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.14" id="Ruth.1.14"/><sup>14</sup>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law,
but Ruth clave unto her.</p>
<p id="Ruth.1-p3">
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.15" data-parsed="Ruth_1_15_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.15" id="Ruth.1.15"/><sup>15</sup>And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people,

<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.16" data-parsed="Ruth_1_16_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.16" id="Ruth.1.16"/><sup>16</sup>And Ruth said,
Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee, for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God; 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.17" data-parsed="Ruth_1_17_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.17" id="Ruth.1.17"/><sup>17</sup>where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: Jehovah do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me. 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.18" data-parsed="Ruth_1_18_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.18" id="Ruth.1.18"/><sup>18</sup>And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking unto her.</p>

<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.21" data-parsed="Ruth_1_21_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.21" id="Ruth.1.21"/><sup>21</sup>I went out full, and Jehovah hath brought me home again empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing Jehovah hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me? 
<span data-osisref="Bible:Ruth.1.22" data-parsed="Ruth_1_22_0_0" data-passage="Ruth 1.22" id="Ruth.1.22"/><sup>22</sup>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</p>
